General Principle\nTaalomy is a platform facilitating connections and payments between students and lecturers. While we do not directly provide the educational content, we facilitate the resolution of disputes regarding payments.\n\n2. Refund Eligibility\nRefunds may be considered under the following circumstances:\n• Cancellation by Lecturer: If a lecturer cancels a scheduled session or course, students are entitled to a full refund of the session fee.\n• Technical Failure: If a technical failure on the Taalomy platform prevents the session from taking place, a full refund will be issued.\n• Non-Delivery: If a lecturer fails to attend a scheduled session without prior notice (No-Show), the student is eligible for a refund pending verification.\n\n3. Non-Refundable Scenarios\n• Completed Sessions: Refunds are not issued for sessions that have already taken place and were attended by the student.\n• Student Cancellations (Late): Cancellations made by the student less than 24 hours before the scheduled start time are typically non-refundable to compensate the lecturer for their reserved time.\n• Dissatisfaction with Content: Refunds based solely on personal dissatisfaction with the lecturer's teaching style or content quality are subject to review and are generally not granted unless there is a clear violation of our terms.\n\n4. Refund Process\nTo request a refund, please contact our support team at support@taalomy.com within 48 hours of the incident. Include your transaction ID, session details, and a brief explanation. Approved refunds will be processed back to the original payment method within 5-10 business days."

Course Transfers\nIn cases where a student has purchased a package or term-long course, transferring enrollment to a different course by the same lecturer may be possible upon request and is subject to price adjustments if applicable.\n\n4. Contact\nFor assistance with rescheduling or course transfers, please use the in-app support tools or contact support@taalomy.com."
